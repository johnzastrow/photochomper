## Understanding This Report

**Confidence Scores:** Indicate how certain the algorithm is that files are duplicates:
- `1.0` = Exact match (identical content)
- `0.9-0.99` = Very high similarity (likely duplicates)
- `0.7-0.89` = High similarity (probably duplicates)
- `<0.7` = Lower similarity (manual review recommended)

**Duplicate Reasons:** Show why files were identified as duplicates:
- Multiple criteria can apply to the same file pair
- Higher percentages indicate more common matching patterns
- `hash` matches are the most reliable (identical content)

**Next Steps:**
1. Review high-confidence matches first (score ‚â• 0.9)
2. Use `python main.py --review` for interactive duplicate management
3. Consider keeping files with better quality, newer dates, or shorter paths
4. Always backup important files before deletion
