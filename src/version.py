PhotoChomper version tracking.

Version numbering follows semantic versioning: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
- MAJOR: Breaking changes or major architecture changes
- MINOR: New features, enhancements, or significant improvements
- PATCH: Bug fixes, small improvements, or maintenance updates

Current version reflects the enhanced v3.0+ features with:
- Advanced progress tracking and time estimation
- Intelligent memory-based chunking
- SHA256 skip option
- Enhanced TUI with real-time feedback
- LSH-optimized similarity detection
