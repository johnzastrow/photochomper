* HashCache comparison errors have been analyzed and identified
* The error "'<' not supported between instances of 'HashCache' and 'int'" indicates a bug where the HashCache object is being used in place of a numeric value
* Root cause: The error appears to be related to variable scoping or assignment issues in the hash computation functions
* Next steps: Implement proper error handling and variable validation in the hash cache methods
